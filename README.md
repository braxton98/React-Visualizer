# React-Visualizer
<hx>**How I worked on This project**</hx> <br/>
My goal was to get a better understanding of the react fundamentals<br/>
The Bulk of the code is in the Vis.js file <--------------

  * I started with the Bubble Sort algorithm <br/>
  * I watched tutorials on React to understand the basics then started messing around with Hooks to be able to change the state of the sorter <br/>

<hx>**Why I built this project**</hx> <br/>
* The purpose of this project was to work on my React skills and start making portfolio projects to show to other people <br/>
